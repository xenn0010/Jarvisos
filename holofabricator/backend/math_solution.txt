Here are the step-by-step solutions:

---

**1. Solve: (2x + 3)(x - 4) = ?**

*   **Distribute (FOIL method):** Multiply each term in the first parenthesis by each term in the second.
    *   (2x)(x) = 2x²
    *   (2x)(-4) = -8x
    *   (3)(x) = 3x
    *   (3)(-4) = -12
*   **Combine like terms:**
    2x² - 8x + 3x - 12
    **Answer:** 2x² - 5x - 12

**2. Find x: 3x + 7 = 22**

*   **Isolate the term with x:** Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.
    3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
    3x = 15
*   **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 3.
    3x / 3 = 15 / 3
    **Answer:** x = 5
